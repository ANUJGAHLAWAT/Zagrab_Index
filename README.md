# Zagrab_Index
To calculate Zagreb Index of a molecule from Smiles Notation

To calculate Randic Index from Smiles Notation in c++ language for cyclic as well as acyclic compounds Randic Index is also topological 
index or connectivity index of a nonhydrogen atoms in a molecule.
It is used as a descriptor for molecules in QSAR studies and for machine learning program.
In this program, I had calculated it by reading Smiles notation with conditions like if it gets bracket then it has to do these things. 
Likewise, I have calculated the Zagreb index for the acyclic as well as cyclic compounds.
